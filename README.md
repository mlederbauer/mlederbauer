- 👋 Hi, I’m @mlederbauer
- 👀 I’m interested in Computational Chemistry and exploring the application of ML in science and student life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about utilizing Machine Learning in Chemistry, designing websites and exploring GitHub with all its features and collaborations. Always eager to learn new and in love with the community already!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML and AI in Chemistry.
- :purple_heart: I'm also a passionate Teaching Assistant and happy to be available for private tutoring in Chemistry! So far, I've made students love Thermodynamics and Inorganic Chemistry :-)
- Other side projects include:
   - Author International Chemistry Olympiad 2023
   - Spartan'20, ORCA & ML in Inorganic Synthetical Chemistry and Undergrad Chemistry Education.
   - More about that on the prospective website soon. :yum:
